## ❓ Why do I do nothing for a long time?
'Cause I have often mood/interests swings for a short period of time, and broken brain. In short, I'm a dumbass piece of shit.

## 🧑‍🔧 Something wrong?
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string transform(std::string animal) {
  return animal;
}

int main() {
  std::cout << transform("cat") << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

## ✳️ P.S.
Btw, what are you doing here?
