## ❓ Why do I do nothing for a long time?
'Cause I have often mood/interests swings for a short period of time, and broken brain. In short, I'm a dumbass piece of shit.

## 🧑‍🔧 Something wrong?
```javascript
function sniffing(action) {
  console.log(`${action} of blow and I'm fine`);
}
sniffing("16 lines");
```

## ✳️ P.S.
Btw, what are you doing here, sweethearts? :3
