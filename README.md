# こんにちは!🌸
This is just a small GitHub page of the slow as Christmas me, who probably will never release something, 'cause my every line of code is a piece of shit. Maybe in one day, I will finally release something cool, but not today 😞

# My head is broken 🥀💔
```javascript
  let alive = true;
  let age = 24; // u still got time, use it wisely

  function do(action) {
    if (action === "daydreaming") { console.log("You're wasting time!"); }
    else { console.error("You're out of self-control!"); }
  }

  while (alive) {
    do("daydreaming");
    age++;
    if (age >= 30) alive = false;
  }
```
